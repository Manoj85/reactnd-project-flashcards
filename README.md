## Mobile Flashcards

UdaciCards project is a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that 
allows users to study collections of flashcards. 
The app will allow users 
- to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", 
- add flashcards to those decks
- then take quizzes on those decks.


This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application 
including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input.
